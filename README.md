# I've trained a Standard NN which categorises Handwritten Digits. The code is in Matlab.
Note: All the files are well documented and commented where I felt necessary

Run the file named HandwrittenDigitsClassification.m which does the following:
1. Loads the dataset HandwrittenDigitsData.mat ad visualises it
2. Initialises the Parameters named Theta1 and Theta2
3. Implements Backprop and Regularisation
4. Trains the NN
5. Visualises the weigths
6. Shows randomly selected images and the NN predicts which Digit it is
